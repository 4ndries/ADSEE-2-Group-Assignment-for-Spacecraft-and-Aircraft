This code shall output a table with achieved deltas with different
types of LE and TE HLD combined.

TE HLD: plain flap, slotted flap, flower flap, double slotted flap
LE HLD: slot, slat, kruger flap

TE HLD might affect: lift slope (extending), moving the curve up (by how much exaclty?,
due to deflection), extending the lift durve (due to slot)
LE HLD might affect: moving curve to the right ()
