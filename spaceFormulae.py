Hereby the variables used in formulae are explained:

Tc -- temperature of the noise introduced by the cable
T0 -- clarify later; given OR reference temperature IF reference, T0 = 290 K
L  -- loss factor, property of a cable
Tn -- temperature of the noise introduced by the amplifier
F  -- noise figure, ratio of noise out to noise into the amp

There are different typical values of antenna noise, L, F, etc. for different frequencies
for downlink/uplink => we need to have a table with different options to get the right values
